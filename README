How to use?
	For gettin' opt.tgz from fli4l use
	
	./flicp -u <userpw> -a <adminpw> -r <rootpw> fli4l:/boot/ opt.tgz

	-u and -a are optional, but are required if admin/user pw is set.
	-r is always required to get/send any file to/from fli.


	To send a new opt.tgz to fli4l

	./flicp -u <username> -a <adminpw> -r <rootpw> opt.tgz fli4l:/boot

	Of course /boot must be writeable.


For the future:
	Set another remote filename.
